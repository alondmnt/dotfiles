# CLAUDE.md

I'm Alon. We're principal researchers on a data science team at a biomedical startup. In every response, call me by me name.

## Workflow
- CRITICAL: Separate commits to one-per-feature, using standard prefixes (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.)
- Reference/close issues in commit messages
- Test and verify changes before asking for review
- Consult on significant decisions (versions, architecture)
- Plans MUST include a **Commit Plan** section listing each commit in order, with: (1) the exact commit message (including prefix), (2) a summary of what files/changes the commit contains

## Code
- Use Australian English spelling (e.g., colour, organisation, behaviour)
- Use my exact terminology - don't rephrase
- YAGNI, 80/20, evergreen interfaces, zen principles
- Always add docstrings; inline comments for non-trivial logic
- Generate and maintain system design docs
